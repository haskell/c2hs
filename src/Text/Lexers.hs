--
--  language: Haskell 98
--
--  The idea is to combine the benefits of off-line generators with
--  combinators like in `Parsers.hs' (which builds on Swierstra/Duponcheel's
--  technique for self-optimizing parser combinators).  In essence, a state
--  transition graph representing a lexer table is computed on the fly, to
--  make lexing deterministic and based on cheap table lookups.
--
--  Regular expression map to Haskell expressions as follows.  If `x' and `y'
--  are regular expressions,
--
--        -> epsilon
--    xy  -> x +> y
--    x*y -> x `star` y
--    x+y -> x `plus` y
--    x?y -> x `quest` y
--
--  Given such a Haskelized regular expression `hre', we can use
--
--    (1) hre `lexaction` \lexeme -> Nothing
--    (2) hre `lexaction` \lexeme -> Just token
--    (3) hre `lexmeta`   \lexeme pos s -> (res, pos', s', Nothing)
--    (4) hre `lexmeta`   \lexeme pos s -> (res, pos', s', Just l)
--
--  where `epsilon' is required at the end of `hre' if it otherwise ends on
--  `star', `plus', or `quest', and then, we have
--
--    (1) discards `lexeme' accepted by `hre',
--    (2) turns the `lexeme' accepted by `hre' into a token,
--    (3) while discarding the lexeme accepted by `hre', transforms the
--        position and/or user state, and
--    (4) while discarding the lexeme accepted by `hre', transforms the
--        position and/or user state and returns a lexer to be used for the
--        next lexeme.
--
--  The component `res' in case of a meta action, can be `Nothing', `Just
--  (Left err)', or `Just (Right token)' to return nothing, an error, or a
--  token from a meta action, respectively.
--
--  * By adding `ctrlLexer', `Positions' are properly handled in the presence
--    of layout control characters.
--
--  * This module makes essential use of graphical data structures (for
--    representing the state transition graph) and laziness (for maintaining
--    the last action in `execLexer'.
--
--  NOTES:
--
--  * In this implementation, the combinators `quest`, `star`, and `plus` are
--    *right* associative - this was different in the ``Lazy Lexing is Fast''
--    paper.  This change was made on a suggestion by Martin Norbäck
--    <d95mback@dtek.chalmers.se>.
--
--- TODO ----------------------------------------------------------------------
--
--  * error correction is missing
--
--  * in (>||<) in the last case, `(addBoundsNum bn bn')' is too simple, as
--    the number of outgoing edges is not the sum of the numbers of the
--    individual states when there are conflicting edges, i.e., ones labeled
--    with the same character; however, the number is only used to decide a
--    heuristic, so it is questionable whether it is worth spending the
--    additional effort of computing the accurate number
--
--  * Unicode posses a problem as the character domain becomes too big for
--    using arrays to represent transition tables and even sparse structures
--    will posse a significant overhead when character ranges are naively
--    represented.  So, it might be time for finite maps again.
--
--    Regarding the character ranges, there seem to be at least two
--    possibilities.  Doaitse explicitly uses ranges and avoids expanding
--    them.  The problem with this approach is that we may only have
--    predicates such as `isAlphaNum' to determine whether a given character
--    belongs to some character class.  From this representation it is
--    difficult to efficiently compute a range.  The second approach, as
--    proposed by Tom Pledger <Tom.Pledger@peace.com> (on the Haskell list)
--    would be to actually use predicates directly and make the whole business
--    efficient by caching predicate queries.  In other words, for any given
--    character after we have determined (in a given state) once what the
--    following state on accepting that character is, we need not consult the
--    predicates again if we memorise the successor state the first time
--    around.
--
--  * Ken Shan <ken@digitas.harvard.edu> writes ``Section 4.3 of your paper
--    computes the definition
--
--      re1 `star` re2 = \l' -> let self = re1 self >||< re2 l' in self
--
--    If we let re2 = epsilon, we get
--
--      many :: Regexp s t -> Regexp s t
--      many re = \l' -> let self = re1 self >||< l' in self
--
--    since epsilon = id.''  This should actually be as good as the current
--    definition and it might be worthwhile to offer it as a variant.
