--- DESCRIPTION ---------------------------------------------------------------
--
--  This module provides basic support for the use of state transformers.
--  The state transformer is build around the `IO' monad to allow the
--  manipulation of external state. It encapsulated two separate states with
--  the intention to use the first one for the omnipresent compiler state
--  consisting of the accumulated error messages etc. and to use the second as
--  a generic component that can be used in different ways by the different
--  phases of the compiler.
--
--  The module also supports the use of exceptions and fatal errors.
--
--- DOCU ----------------------------------------------------------------------
--
--  language: Haskell 98
--
--  * We explicitly do not use any names for the monad types and functions
--    that are used by either Haskell's `IO' monad or GHC's `ST' monad.  Since
--    Haskell 1.4, `STB' is an instance of the `Monad' constructor class.
--
--  * To integrate the Haskell prelude `IO' monad into our `STB' monad we use
--    the technique from ``Composing monads'' by Mark P. Jones and Luc
--    Duponcheel (Report YALEU/DCS/RR-1004) from 1993, Section 8.
--
--  * The use of GHC's inplace-update goodies within monads of kind `STB' is
--    possible, bacause `IO' is based on `ST' in the GHC.
--
--  * In the following, we call the two kinds of state managed by the `STB' the
--    base state (the omnipresent state of the compiler) and generic state.
--
--  * `STB' is a newtype, which requires careful wrapping and unwrapping of its
--    values in the following definitions.
--
--- TODO ----------------------------------------------------------------------
--
--  * with constructor classes, the state transformer business can be made
--    more elegant (they weren't around when this module was initially written)
--
--  * it would be possible to maintain the already applied changes to the base
--    and generic state even in the case of a fatal error, when in `listIO'
--    every IO operation is encapsulated into a handler that transforms IO
--    errors into exceptions

-- error and exception handling
-- ----------------------------

-- * we exploit the 'UserError' component of 'IOError' for fatal errors
--
-- * we distinguish exceptions and user-defined fatal errors
--
--   - exceptions are meant to be caught in order to recover the currently
--     executed operation; they turn into fatal errors if they are not caught;
--     execeptions are tagged, which allows to deal with multiple kinds of
--     execeptions at the same time and to handle them differently
--   - user-defined fatal errors abort the currently executed operation, but
--     they may be caught at the top-level in order to terminate gracefully or
--     to invoke another operation; there is no special support for different
--     handling of different kinds of fatal-errors
--
-- * the costs for fatal error handling are already incurred by the 'IO' monad;
--   the costs for exceptions mainly is the case distinction in the definition
--   of '+>='
--

-- | throw an exception with the given tag and message
--
throwExc         :: String -> String -> STB bs gs a
throwExc tag msg  = STB $ \bs gs -> return (bs, gs, Left (tag, msg))

-- | raise a fatal user-defined error
--
-- * such an error my be caught and handled using 'fatalsHandeledBy'
--
fatal   :: String -> STB bs gs a
fatal s  = liftIO (ioError (userError s))

-- | the given state transformer is executed and exceptions with the given tag
-- are caught using the provided handler, which expects to get the exception
-- message
--
-- * the base and generic state observed by the exception handler is *modified*
--   by the failed state transformer upto the point where the exception was
--   thrown (this semantics is the only reasonable when it should be possible
--   to use updating for maintaining the state)
--
