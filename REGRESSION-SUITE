                        C2HS REGRESSION SUITE
                        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

C2HS is flexible enough that it's difficult to write a test suite that
covers all the cases of interest to users.  As well as a general test
suite and tests for individual issues, it makes sense to test for C2HS
regressions by installing a range of packages that use C2HS.

The regression suite is managed as a single Cabal test suite called
regression-suite.  This reads a YAML configuration file giving a list
of packages to test against.  The test suite succeeds if a "cabal
install" of each of the test packages succeeds without error, using
the current version of C2HS.

This process requires care for two reasons:

 1. Because C2HS is an FFI tool, packages that use C2HS almost always
    have dependencies on external libraries, so writing a simple test
    suite is not straightforward.

 2. It's undesirable to install a whole set of Haskell packages for
    C2HS regression testing into the user's environment.

To handle these two issues, the regression-suite test suite behaves as
follows:

 ON TRAVIS

  - Always run the regression suite.

  - Install all library dependencies before attempting to install
    Haskell packages.  These dependencies are given in the regression
    suite configuration file as lists of APT package names, optionally
    with PPAs to install them from, or as lists of shell commands to
    use to install the dependencies.

 ON NON-TRAVIS SYSTEMS

  - Only run the regression suite if the C2HS_REGRESSION_SUITE
    environment variable is defined.

  - Assume that all C library dependencies are already installed.

  - Set Cabal flags from environment variables called
    C2HS_REGRESSION_FLAGS_<package> if these variables exist.


The idea is to test for regressions under well-controlled conditions
at each commit on Travis, but maintain the possibility of running the
regression suite locally as well.
