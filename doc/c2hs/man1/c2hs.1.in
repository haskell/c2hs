.SH NAME
c2hs \- C->Haskell Interface Generator

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B c2hs
.RB [ OPTIONS ]...
.I header-file
.I binding-file

.SH DESCRIPTION
This manual page briefly describes the
.B c2hs
command.  For more details, refer to the main documentation, which is
available in various other formats, including SGML and HTML; see below.
.PP

.SH OPTIONS
The programs follow the usual GNU command line syntax, with long options
starting with two dashes (`-'). A summary of options are included below. For
a complete description, see the other documentation.

.B c2hs
accepts the following options:
.TP
.B  \-h, \-?, \-\-help
brief help
.TP
.B  \-v, \-\-version
show version information
.TP
.BI \-c \ CPP\fR, \ \-\-cpp= CPP
use executable \fICPP\fR to invoke C preprocessor
.TP
.BR \-C \ CPPOPTS\fR, \ \-\-cppopts= CPPOPTS
pass CPPOPTS to the C preprocessor
.TP
.BR \-d \ TYPE\fR, \ \-\-dump= TYPE
dump internal information (for debugging), where TYPE is one of:
.RS
.IP "\(bu \fBtrace\fR" 10
trace compiler phases
.IP "\(bu \fBchs\fR"   10
dump the binding file (adds \fI.dump\fR to the name)
.RE
.TP
.BI \-o \ FILE\fR, \ \-\-output= FILE
output result to \fIFILE\fR (should end in \fI.hs\fR)
.TP
.B  \-k, \-\-keep
keep pre-processed C header
.PP

.I header-file
is the header file belonging to the marshalled library. It must end with
suffix 
.IR .h .

.I binding-file
is the corresponding Haskell binding file, which must end with suffix
.IR .chs .

The most useful of these options is probably 
.B  \-\-cppopts
(or 
.BR \-C ).
If the C header file needs any special options (like \-D or \-I) to go
through the C pre-processor, here is the place to pass them.

.SH EXAMPLES

The C->Haskell Interface Generator is usually called as:

.B c2hs
.I lib.h Lib.chs

where 
.I  lib.h
is the header file and
.I  Lib.chs
the Haskell binding module, which define the C- and Haskell-side interface,
respectively.  If no errors occur, the result is a pure Haskell module
.IR Lib.hs ,
which implements the Haskell API of the library.

A more advanced call may look like this:

.BR "c2hs \-\-cppopts=" '\-I\fI/some/obscure/dir\fR
-DEXTRA'
.I lib.h Lib.chs

Often, 
.I  lib.h
will not be in the current directory, but in one of the header file
directories.  Apart from the current directory, C->Haskell looks in two
places for the header: first, in the standard include directory of the used
system, this is usually
.IR /usr/include " and " /usr/local/include ;
and second, it will look in every directory that is mentioned in a 
.RI \-I DIR
option passed to the pre-processor via 
.BR \-\-cppopts .

.SH CAVEATS
Do not forget the quotes if you have more than one option that you want to
give to the pre-processor.
